# Database-System

In this project, you need to design a database system for a given domain. For this, first you need to conduct research about the domain itself and collect data requirements (such as information about the main components of the system, how the system works, how different entities interact with each other etc.) Then you will try to design a system as practical as possible. This means, assumptions you make should comply with real-world situations/scenarios. 

Procedure:

1. Write the data requirements for the system.
2. Draw the initial ER diagram for your system.
   A minimal system design should include at least: 
  a. two one-to-one binary relationships.
  b. two one-to-many binary relationships.
  c. two many-to-many binary relationships.
3. Map the ER diagram into relational schema. Show the resulting relational schema: show your tables, primary keys and foreign keys.
4. Create tables using appropriate SQL command. Make sure to include primary key and foreign key definitions and triggered actions on foreign keys. Decide also about NOT NULL constraints and DEFAULT values for the attributes.
